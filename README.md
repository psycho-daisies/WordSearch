+ Word Search program generates a 2D grid of Words from a list of words.
+ The user can add the words to a list or use a supplied list of words.
+ Each word is checked if it can fit on the grid in the specified row and column, 
+ and checked in all directions for overlaps with other words on the grid. 
+ If there is an overlap, and it's within the bounds it can be placed.
